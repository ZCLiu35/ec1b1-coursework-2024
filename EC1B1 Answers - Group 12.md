# 5.1 Comprehension and Warm Up

• What was the Bretton Woods system? Did it have any clear advantages over the previous gold standard system?

• What disadvantages did it have and to what extent did the gold standard system suffer from similar issues?

• The IMF was established during the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944. Briefly explain its role and how it contributed to the functioning of the Bretton Woods system.

• What was the date that your country left the Bretton Woods system? Explain how you determined this.
<br> – If two dates seem plausible, pick one and explain why you’re chosen that particular date.

• Describe the sense in which the departure from Bretton Woods represents a “natural experiment” about the effects of real exchange rate fluctuations on the macroeconomy.

# 5.2 Cleaning

• How many monthly observations are there in your dataset? Is this the number you were expecting?

• Why are we studying monthly data? Why not some lower-frequency such as quarterly or annual data?

• What is industrial production? Why are we studying industrial production instead of another series, such as GDP?

• Why are you dropping outliers?

• Discuss some pros and cons of the interpolation procedure we are using.

# 5.3 Analysis
For all graphs in 5.3, ensure you clearly indicate the time at which your country left the Bretton Woods system and show the relevant series for every month from the start to the end of your dataset.

## 5.3.1 Exchange Rate and International Reserve Graphs

Plot a time series graph of the monthly growth in nominal exchange rates of your country, versus the US dollar.

Plot a time series graph of the monthly growth in real exchange rates of your country, versus the US dollar.

Plot a time series graph of the real exchange rate level of your country, versus the US dollar.

• Why is it useful to plot both real and nominal exchange rate growth?

• Was the US dollar over or undervalued in the Bretton Woods system? Refer to data or figures in
your answer.

Plot a time series graph of the monthly indexed value of international reserves of your country and the US from January 1960 until the exit of the US from Bretton Woods.

• Using your above figures, explain one reason for the US’s departure from the Bretton Woods system.

## 5.3.2 Inflation and Industrial Production Graphs

• Plot a time series graph of monthly inflation.

• Plot a time series graph of the monthly growth in industrial production.

• Plot a time series graph of the growth in industrial production versus 12 months ago.

• Why are your results for the monthly versus 12 monthly growth in industrial production so different? Which measure 
is more useful?

## 5.3.3 Comparison Statistics

• Separately for both the period before and after Bretton Woods, calculate the standard deviation
of:
– The monthly growth of nominal exchange rates versus the US dollar.
– The monthly growth of real exchange rates versus the US dollar.
– The inflation rate in your country.
– The difference between the inflation in your country versus the United States.
– The 12-monthly industrial production growth.

• When you calculate the standard deviation of variables before Bretton Woods, include data up to 07/1971. When you calculate the standard deviation of variables after Bretton Woods, only include data from 01/1973.

• Report these numbers in a suitably formatted table, as well as the ratio of the standard deviation of each variable before and after Bretton Woods.

• Why might it be a good idea to exclude data from 08/1971 to 12/1972 for the above calculations? 

# 5.4 Conclusion & Extension

• Taken together, what do your results imply about the effect of real exchange rate fluctuations? Is there a reason why your results are particularly compelling?

• It is perhaps more natural to consider changes in levels rather than changes in volatility. Is there evidence that the average level of nominal and/or real exchange rates changed markedly post Bretton Woods? What about the average levels of inflation and production? What could be some pitfalls of using this to infer causal changes in the level of industrial production or inflation due to exchange rate differences?
